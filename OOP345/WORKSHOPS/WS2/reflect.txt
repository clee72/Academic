1. the reason for the significant time difference between the copy and move operation.

Copy constructor and move assignment operator take lvalue reference as an argument.  Copy assignment operator replaces the contents of one existing object with a copy of the contents of another object. Copy assignment operator uses more memory space, as compared to the move assignment operator. As a result, it is slow, too.
Therefore, copying is not the most efficient way to work.
Since move assignment operator moves data from one object to another object. For instance, if there are two objects called "A" and  "B" and move operator moves ownership from object A  to B,  A may no longer hold on to the memory.  Therefore we set the object A to be an empty state. Because the rvalue is the temporary object, it will be destroyed soon anyway.

From this workshop, I have a better understanding of move and copy operation, according to lvalue and rvalue. Especially, I understood when the move constructor and move operator are called.  These are called when we assign an object to function or rvalue, which will be a temporary object.  While I was doing this workshop, I had some difficulties with the file stream.  My problem was that I did not pass the file name(e.g., std::ifstream fin(fname);), when I created a tempory object (e.g., fin) of fstream. Instead, I declared an instance variable( e.g.,string fname;) in the class "Text".  After this workshop was done, I became more clear about file stream syntax.
